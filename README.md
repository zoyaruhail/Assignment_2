The program works as follows:

Prompts the user to enter a number

Converts the input to an integer

Checks:

If the number is divisible by 2 → Even

Otherwise → Odd

Prints the result in an easy-to-read format

## Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

This is a simple Python program that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 50 using a for loop. It demonstrates basic iteration, variable initialization, and arithmetic operations in Python.

### Features

Uses a loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 50

Accumulates the total using a running sum variable

Prints the final sum clearly

Easy to understand for beginners learning loops and variables

### Code Overview

Initializes a variable sum1 with value 0

Uses a for loop to iterate through numbers 1 to 50

Adds each number to sum1

Outputs the final result in a readable format
